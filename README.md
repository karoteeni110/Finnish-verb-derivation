# Finnish-verb-derivation
My final project for LDA-T3101 Computation morphology (2019)

# My plan
To build a guesser that derives a new verb (output) from the input verb (input). 

The input verb should be a _perussana_ (Fin. "basic word", i.e. a word that is composed of a single morpheme and have not gone through any derivational change), and the output verb contains a single or a double derivational morpheme (Fin. johdin; See [ยง 306 Yhdistymismahdollisuuksista ja -periaatteista](http://scripta.kotus.fi/visk/sisallys.php?p=306)).

The output does not perserve "correct", since the derivational form of the verb could be exist in principle but has not been used in real life (See [ยง 158 Monitulkintaisuutta kannan ja johtimen erottamisessa](http://scripta.kotus.fi/visk/sisallys.php?p=158)).
